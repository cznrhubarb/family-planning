Family Planning

Family Planning is a physics-based block-stacking game used as a metaphor for building a family tree. In this game you will get marry off adults, who will have children so that when they get older, someone will prevent them from dying too early. The children will then get older themselves and perpetuate the cycle. I'm essentially calling families a form of pyramid scheme.

You can play the game in browser on [itch.io](https://whatismikedoingnow.itch.io/family-planning).

This game was made for the [Godot Wild Jam](https://godotwildjam.com/) two year [anniversary jam](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-24-our-2-year). This is my first time participating, as well as my first time doing all of my own art and music for a game. I still had to get the sounds from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/), but maybe one day I'll become a Foley artist as well.

Theme for the jam was Family, and I also used the Watchmaker wild card.
